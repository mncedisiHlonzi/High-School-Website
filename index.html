                        I started my journey as a student at Shengeza High School from year 2004to 2008.
                        My experience at Shengeza High School has been a journey worth a climb.
                        My high school is located in the deep rural areas with scarce resources despite the limitation in infrastructure and  limited exposure in technology I was able to studying and get Good grades, during my years at Shengeza I got an opportunity to be Class chosen as one of the students to represent the whole school in the District for an Essay writing in 2004 and obtained position 6 from the whole district which enabled me to improve my confidence as well as self-development. I gained great experience and exposure as i was then chosen as one of the trusted students in unprepared debates in and out the school premises and where I would put my school on of the map in the debating field.
                        As alluded above during my time at shengeza there was a time when i was selected as one of the students to represent the school in science expo where me and my partner designed a bridge that as of then i had developed a huge interest in Civil engineering fast forward to that I continued being a hard and dedicated leaner and end passing my matriculation in 2008 with a bachelor that gave me more chances to become or study what i had liked and loved with the bottom of my heart civil engineering.
                        I have then after matriculation followed my dreams went to MUT to study Civil engineering as a deep desire and interest in the field of Construction as of today and can confidently say that I am owning and running my company called Imanathi and Seloe Trading that deals with construction of roads, houses,water infrastructure as well bridges as of today the company has employed employees from different parts of construction . Inspiration came from School and through the excellent education system and dedication of our Teachers i can attest that i am the man that--> I am today because of Shengeza High school as of today i still have a good relationship with my high school teachers hence they taught me manors and a way to handle myself in a way that i have one come to school and gave back to the most needy students since it is what i have learnt from them.

These experiences taught me to be reselient, being true to my self and gave me a clear direction of who and what I wanted to be in life.--> Grateful for all the support I received from all the teachers, they believed in me and that motivated me to always push and aim high.

                        <!--I enrolled at Shengeza High School at the birth of the new millennium in year 2000, at the time when it was not fashionable to be a Shengeza High learner due to the then poor performance of the school. I have a very little memory of the earlier years, but I can recall that when Mr M Manyapye took over as the headmaster in 2001/2002 things started to change and discipline became the order of the day despite limited teaching resources. We did not have textbooks, libraries, computers nor laboratories. However, the senior educators of the school (i.e. Mr Mhlongo, S Mkhize, SS Ngubane, etc) and arrival of educators from other provinces (i.e. Ms Rapagkadi) really stabilized the school’s performance. The journey was a challenging one, but dedication, hard work, sacrifices and support from the teachers kept us going.-->  
                        I was the first matriculant to obtain 4 distinctions coming from Shengeza High School in 2004, and since then the school has been doing well as I have been following its matric performance over the years. <!--From what I have recently observed, the school is now anchored by local educators who understand the socioeconomic dynamics of the area. This is definitely adding value in propelling the performance of the school and will go a long way in shaping the culture and identity of the school as a community institution.  
                        What I would like to say as an advice to current learners is that they must keep their heads up as their current situation does not define their destination. They must grab every opportunity presented and should not shy from embracing or even becoming part of changes dominated by technological advancements. 
                        Mr Njomane used to say “Scorn the delight and live a laborious life”-->

                        I was a student at Shengeza High School from year 2005 to 2009.
                        My experience at Shengeza High School has been a journey worth a climb.-->
                        My high school is located in the deep rural areas with scarce resources despite the limitation in infrastructure and limited exposure in technology I was able to studying and get Good grades <!--, during my years at Shengeza I got an opportunity to be Class Representative which enabled me to improve my personal leadership skills as well as self-debelopment. I gained great experience and exposure as a class rep, I regained my confidence.

                        As alluded above during my time at shengeza there was a lot of development of infrastructure taking place and I remember one time at school there was a construction company on site that was building classes, part of the people who were on site were quantity surveyor. I remember during breaktime I went to this man who were working on site and started enquiring about their work and what they studied. 

                        I developed a deep desire and interest in the field of Construction and quantity surveying today and can confidently say that I am owning and running a company called Zoko Group that deals with construction, quantity surveying and Architecture. Inspiration came from School and through the excellent education system and dedication of our Teachers I was able to strive in my Matric marks and went to University to further my studies.

                        I made friend at school who later become my brother, I am a leader in different organization and the credit goes to Shengeza High School for opening an opportunity for me to Lead and also be led.-->

                    My time at Shengeza High School as an SGB member made me learn a lot. As a mother, it was a pleasure to me to be the mother of the learners. The school allowed me to grow in many things, my communication skill grew by interacting with teachers in many angles of life, by talking to learners motivating them made me realise that I can stand in front of many people and present and by this skill I am now the agent of Old Mutual, I now do presentations to many people.

                    Positive connections between us, parents and teachers have been shown to improve children's academic achievement, social competencies and emotional wellbeing. When we, parents and teachers work together as partners, learners do better in school and at home.
                    I contributed so much towards the school growth and development, with the help of the teachers and parents by supporting them and by becoming their mentors, coaching opportunities, after school tutoring and late night classes. We also help in sponsoring a club or organisation( for those learners with talents of playing football and netball. ).
