                    “ I am Sydney Sboniso Ngubane III, the third principal of Shengeza High School since its inception in 1995. I take immense pride in being an integral part of Shengeza High School, having joined in 2000 as a History and IsiZulu teacher at the age of 24. In 2013, at the age of 37, I was appointed as principal following the departure of Mr. MA Manyapye, who remains my mentor to this day.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Here</span><br>
                    Upon joining the school, my primary areas of focus were maintaining discipline for effective learning and teaching, restoring a culture of quality learning and teaching, protecting contact time, eliminating loitering during teaching hours, actively involving different stakeholders, fostering good human relations amongst staff, and fostering positive interactions with learners, parents, and the community at large. Additionally, I aimed to improve academic performance across all grades.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Here</span><br>
                    Through teamwork, I can confidently say that our learners are exhibiting exemplary behavior, as evidenced by their level of performance, punctuality, and adherence to the school uniform policy. As a result of various stakeholders' involvement, acts of vandalism and theft have decreased drastically. The school's performance is steadily improving every academic year due to the restoration of a culture of learning and teaching, which involves curriculum delivery, management and monitoring, staff appraisal through QMS, and staff development workshops.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Here</span><br>
                    Last year, in 2023, our matric class achieved an impressive 89.4%, a significant improvement from the previous year's 80.1%. This year, in 2024, our target is to attain a 100% pass rate with quality results. ”
