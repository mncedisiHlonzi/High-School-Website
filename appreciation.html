                    “ I, Mrs. N. N. Ngubane, was the founder of Shengeza High School in January 1995. At its inception, the school had only four classrooms, all lacking a roof. Administrative tasks were carried out under a tree. I was assigned to this endeavor by Mr. AB Ntuli from the Ubonjeni Circuit Office. Initially, I was the sole teacher responsible for opening the school. Mr. CM Mlambo served as the chairperson, and together we mobilized funds to complete the roofing, enabling teaching and learning to commence.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Here</span><br>
                    Grade 8 and 9 students were enrolled in the inaugural year. Despite the challenging conditions, by the end of 1995, our staff had grown to include five teachers. However, there were still shortages of textbooks and desks. I quickly organized these essentials while overseeing the completion of the roofing project.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Here</span><br>
                    The following year marked the introduction of the first Grade 10 class, and by 1999, the school celebrated its first cohort of matriculants. Among them was KT Ngubane, who now serves as a teacher at Shengeza High School.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Here</span><br>
                    Initially, the school offered streams in Commerce, General, and Science, with Shengeza being the first high school to introduce Commerce in the Umhlabuyalingana CMC. I held the distinction of being the only female high school principal in the area at the time.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Here</span><br>
                    By the end of 2000, the infrastructure had expanded to include seven additional classrooms. In 2001, I was promoted to the role of circuit manager at the uBombo circuit. Despite this career advancement, Shengeza High School remained a source of immense pride for me, as I reflect on its remarkable achievements.<br>

                    “ I, Mr Manyapye M A, was employed at Shengeza high school in 1996, During that time I was  the first Educator  to introduce commercial subjects in the school and Manguzi circuit.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Here</span><br>
                    The school is situated in deep rural area at umhlabuyalinga municipality. During that time the school was having four classrooms with grade 8,9and10. unfortunately I was  teaching commercial subjects which was taught in the classroom that was used as staffroom and as principal's office meaning during my period I was teaching grade 8 and 9 learners in the presence of the principal and other Educators who are free. because of shortage of  classrooms.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Here</span><br>
                    In 1999 I was promoted to become a Departmental head of commerce. I taught BS and Economics in Grade 12 and I managed to produce 96% in BS and 94%in Economics first time teaching grade 12. I was a cluster coordinator at Manguzi circuit for commercial subjects for 6 years.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Here</span><br>
                    In 2001 acted as school principal after my principal Mrs Ngubane NN was promoted to be a circuit manager. In 2002 I was officially promoted to be the school principal where by our school obtained 76%percent in Grade 12 results that year.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Here</span><br>

                    When coming to extramural activities the school was doing well specially in choral music which was conducted by Mr mthembu which is well known actor Mr Nyawo of uzalo.

                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Here</span><br>
                    The school managed to produce best Educators that most of them become principals, subjects advisors , circuit managers, cluster manager, former mayor of local municipality and former district mayor. some of the learners that were admitted in the school  were drop-outs from other schools and have lost hope in life but Shengeza was the only school in the circuit that was restoring hope and dreams of those rejected learners from other schools.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Here</span><br>
                    Those  learners changed the attitude and start believing in themselves because the educators of Shengeza  are highly dedicated, committed and passionate when coming to teaching and learning mostly all those rejected learners they were excelling in different activities in the schooI.

                    not going to afford assisting learners as matric demands lot of time.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Here</span><br>
                    Subsequently I joined the Institution late January after taking deep considerations. I was 
                    tasked to teach Mathematics Grade 11 to12 and Maths Lit Grade 10. It was not my first time 
                    to teach Mathematics as before I joined the College I was at Isicelosethu High teaching 
                    Maths and Physical Science.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Here</span><br>
                    Connection with Learners<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Here</span><br>
                    • This was a great moment for me. During holidays, educators used to divide 
                    themselves to two groups for extra classes. I was common in both groups as I was the 
                    only one who was not working on weekends. During revisions I used to assist them on 
                    Sundays after my radio gig.<br> 
                    • I used to buy some refreshment for the learners to eat after our Sunday classes.<br> 
                    • Learners would sometimes come and call me to their class when there is a free period 
                    or when the concerned educator is not present that day<br>
                    • I used to go with them to attend workshops at Empangeni, yoh we had some fun, they 
                    would brag to other learners from other schools when they want to take pictures with
                    me (their teacher)<br>
                    • The principal would think that there is no educator in our class and come find that we 
                    are laughing while learning. We had some fun during learning. 
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Here</span><br>
                    Method of teaching<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Here</span><br>
                    • Sometimes I would prepare one Maths test for Grade 10 to 12 and announce the 
                    results, Top 10 at the morning assembly.<br>
                    • Everyday there was a classwork and homework after a lesson. I was marking both 
                    works in class myself.<br>
                    • For classwork, homework and tests, I used previous question papers or similar 
                    problems.<br> 
                    • I made sure that my marking for homework and classwork was hasher than test and 
                    exam.<br>
                    • I had a computer so I was typing my tests papers.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Here</span><br>
                    Being involved in Grade 12 Marking<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Here</span><br>
                    • I was also one of the markers and that made me confident when teaching kids because 
                    I knew what is needed.<br>
                    • I was also a Maths Class Coordinator for Manguzi Cluster. Hence I used to go and 
                    assist other schools and sometimes invite other teachers from other schools to come 
                    and assist us.<br>

                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Here</span><br>
                    • I formed a Shengeza High School Choir, we won and went to Ulundi and represent 
                    our District.<br>
                    • Our choir used to perform during school events<br>

                    • 2008 it was the commencement of NCS in Grade 12, we had no previous question 
                    papers only one Exemplar Question Paper.<br> 
                    • It was my first year at Shengeza , my 1st year of teaching grade 12 Mathematics. I 
                    achieved the following in Maths Grade 12 :<br>
                    o 2008 : 33%<vr></vr>
                    o 2009 : 64% ( 3 of my learners were in Top20 of Umhlabuyalingana 
                    achievers awards. One of them got level 7 and 2 level 6s)<br>
                    o 2010 : 82%<br>
                    o 2011: 78%<br>

                    My journey ended in 2012<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Here</span><br>
                    • Unfortunately I left my learners to join Eskom on March 2012 but I cam back and do 
                    revision after marking their March exams papers.<br> 
                    • I am glad there are some learners who got scholarship at Eskom through my 
                    recommendations.<br>
                    • That why I came back in 2023 to give some learners some school shoes.<br>
                    • I am one of the actors on SABC1 number 1 series Uzalo but I know that there is 
                    another home for me Shengeza High School. ”<br>
