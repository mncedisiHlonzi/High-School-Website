                    “ I, Mrs. N. N. Ngubane, was the founder of Shengeza High School in January 1995. At its inception, the school had only four classrooms, all lacking a roof. Administrative tasks were carried out under a tree. I was assigned to this endeavor by Mr. AB Ntuli from the Ubonjeni Circuit Office. Initially, I was the sole teacher responsible for opening the school. Mr. CM Mlambo served as the chairperson, and together we mobilized funds to complete the roofing, enabling teaching and learning to commence.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    Grade 8 and 9 students were enrolled in the inaugural year. Despite the challenging conditions, by the end of 1995, our staff had grown to include five teachers. However, there were still shortages of textbooks and desks. I quickly organized these essentials while overseeing the completion of the roofing project.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    The following year marked the introduction of the first Grade 10 class, and by 1999, the school celebrated its first cohort of matriculants. Among them was KT Ngubane, who now serves as a teacher at Shengeza High School.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    Initially, the school offered streams in Commerce, General, and Science, with Shengeza being the first high school to introduce Commerce in the Umhlabuyalingana CMC. I held the distinction of being the only female high school principal in the area at the time.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    By the end of 2000, the infrastructure had expanded to include seven additional classrooms. In 2001, I was promoted to the role of circuit manager at the uBombo circuit. Despite this career advancement, Shengeza High School remained a source of immense pride for me, as I reflect on its remarkable achievements. ”<br>

                    “ I, Mr Manyapye M A, was employed at Shengeza high school in 1996, During that time I was  the first Educator  to introduce commercial subjects in the school and Manguzi circuit.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    The school is situated in deep rural area at umhlabuyalinga municipality. During that time the school was having four classrooms with grade 8,9and10. unfortunately I was  teaching commercial subjects which was taught in the classroom that was used as staffroom and as principal's office meaning during my period I was teaching grade 8 and 9 learners in the presence of the principal and other Educators who are free. because of shortage of  classrooms.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    In 1999 I was promoted to become a Departmental head of commerce. I taught BS and Economics in Grade 12 and I managed to produce 96% in BS and 94%in Economics first time teaching grade 12. I was a cluster coordinator at Manguzi circuit for commercial subjects for 6 years.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    In 2001 acted as school principal after my principal Mrs Ngubane NN was promoted to be a circuit manager. In 2002 I was officially promoted to be the school principal where by our school obtained 76%percent in Grade 12 results that year.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    I managed to build 8 more classrooms and learners enrollment increase from 280 to 620 and Educators from 10 to 20  having 5 SMT members(4 heads of department and 1 Deputy principal).The school from 2003 to 2011 managed to obtain 80% to 94% in Grade 12 results for more than 8 years. sometimes the school became  number one or number two in circuit performance.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    When coming to extramural activities the school was doing well specially in choral music which was conducted by Mr mthembu which is well known actor Mr Nyawo of uzalo. The school produced best learners some of them are Doctors, teachers, Nurses, businessman and engineers and most of those learners come from disadvantaged families.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    The school managed to produce best Educators that most of them become principals, subjects advisors , circuit managers, cluster manager, former mayor of local municipality and former district mayor. some of the learners that were admitted in the school  were drop-outs from other schools and have lost hope in life but Shengeza was the only school in the circuit that was restoring hope and dreams of those rejected learners from other schools.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    Those  learners changed the attitude and start believing in themselves because the educators of Shengeza  are highly dedicated, committed and passionate when coming to teaching and learning mostly all those rejected learners they were excelling in different activities in the schooI. I spend 16 years in the school 4 years, as PL1 educator, 2 years HOD and 10 years school principal until I was promoted in 2012 to become kosi bay circuit manager. ”<br>

                    “ I, Rapakgadi S.O, joined Shengeza High School in January 2004 as a Life Sciences teacher. Initially, I worked as a temporary teacher until April 2005 when I became permanently appointed. The Mnyayisa community and the school welcomed me warmly. Despite my challenge of not being able to speak IsiZulu or IsiTonga fluently, I could understand a bit of IsiZulu. Surprisingly, this weakness became my strength, as learners had to communicate with me in English, thereby improving their proficiency in the language.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    Shengeza High School wasn't just a workplace; it was my second family. We functioned as a cohesive team, evident in our unplanned Friday braais at 'Sondelani' butchery, attended by all staff members, including the Senior Management Team (SMT). This camaraderie often surprised teachers from neighboring schools. Led by Mr. Manyapye M.A, the SMT encouraged proactivity, innovation, and leadership among teachers in various activities, be it debates, music, or sports. Collaboration, networking, and effective delegation were also promoted.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    When Mr. Ngubane S.S returned as Principal, he continued with the same principles, fostering a supportive environment. I was entrusted with leadership roles in numerous committees, such as timetable, social, IQMS, CPTD, and SCO. In 2005, I was elected as the Life Sciences Cluster Coordinator for Manguzi Circuit, a position I held annually until my departure in 2015. Additionally, I presented Grade 12 Life Sciences on Maputaland Community Radio.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br> 
                    I extend my gratitude to the Manguzi Circuit Manager, Mrs. Ngubane N.N, Advisors Mr. Mtshali R.B, Mr. Ngcobo T.L, and Mr. Mhlongo H.S, as well as Manguzi circuit High school Principals for their support in Matric Intervention Programmes (MIP). Recognizing my contributions, I was promoted to HOD for Sciences in 2011. I appreciate the support of the Sciences Department team, including Mrs. Willemse J.A.E, Mrs. Mdletshe M, Mr. Mthembu C.N, Mr. Zakwe S.F, and Ms. Rasebotje K.M.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    I also served as the SADTU site steward and educational convenor. The school backed me in my pursuit of the National Teachers Award (NTA) in 2012 and 2013, reaching the provincial and national levels, respectively. Additionally, I mentored other teachers on entering and preparing for NTA, leading to Mrs. Willemse J.A.E securing the top position at the national level, thus putting Shengeza on the map.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    Furthermore, I was appointed for Life Sciences ASC/NSC examination marking. In November 2015, I left Shengeza High School upon my promotion to Life Sciences Senior Education Specialist. The skills and experiences acquired during my tenure at Shengeza High School prepared me for my current position in the Department of Education, shaping me into an effective leader and manager. ”<br>

                    I learned a lot from the institution, amongst others I learned how to interact with people from different cultural backgrounds. I acquired immense knowledge on professionalism, discipline, assertiveness, and how to work towards goal achievement.

                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    I joined Shengeza High School 2008 after I was approached by the then Principal M. A. 
                    Manyapye in December 2007. It was not an easy decision as I was a lecturer at Mthashana 
                    FET college teaching Engineering Science, Mathematics and Electrical Technology subjects. 
                    My problem was that I was not going to be available during weekends as I was working at 
                    Maputaland Community Radio every Friday to Sunday so as a Grade 12 Maths educator was 
                    not going to afford assisting learners as matric demands lot of time.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    Subsequently I joined the Institution late January after taking deep considerations. I was 
                    tasked to teach Mathematics Grade 11 to12 and Maths Lit Grade 10. It was not my first time 
                    to teach Mathematics as before I joined the College I was at Isicelosethu High teaching 
                    Maths and Physical Science.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    Connection with Learners<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    • This was a great moment for me. During holidays, educators used to divide 
                    themselves to two groups for extra classes. I was common in both groups as I was the 
                    only one who was not working on weekends. During revisions I used to assist them on 
                    Sundays after my radio gig.<br> 
                    • I used to buy some refreshment for the learners to eat after our Sunday classes.<br> 
                    • Learners would sometimes come and call me to their class when there is a free period 
                    or when the concerned educator is not present that day<br>
                    • I used to go with them to attend workshops at Empangeni, yoh we had some fun, they 
                    would brag to other learners from other schools when they want to take pictures with
                    me (their teacher)<br>
                    • The principal would think that there is no educator in our class and come find that we 
                    are laughing while learning. We had some fun during learning. 
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    Method of teaching<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    • Sometimes I would prepare one Maths test for Grade 10 to 12 and announce the 
                    results, Top 10 at the morning assembly.<br>
                    • Everyday there was a classwork and homework after a lesson. I was marking both 
                    works in class myself.<br>
                    • For classwork, homework and tests, I used previous question papers or similar 
                    problems.<br> 
                    • I made sure that my marking for homework and classwork was hasher than test and 
                    exam.<br>
                    • I had a computer so I was typing my tests papers.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    Being involved in Grade 12 Marking<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    • I was also one of the markers and that made me confident when teaching kids because 
                    I knew what is needed.<br>
                    • I was also a Maths Class Coordinator for Manguzi Cluster. Hence I used to go and 
                    assist other schools and sometimes invite other teachers from other schools to come 
                    and assist us.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>

                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    • I formed a Shengeza High School Choir, we won and went to Ulundi and represent 
                    our District.<br>
                    • Our choir used to perform during school events<br>

                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    • 2008 it was the commencement of NCS in Grade 12, we had no previous question 
                    papers only one Exemplar Question Paper.<br> 
                    • It was my first year at Shengeza , my 1st year of teaching grade 12 Mathematics. I 
                    achieved the following in Maths Grade 12 :<br>
                    o 2008 : 33%<br>
                    o 2009 : 64% ( 3 of my learners were in Top20 of Umhlabuyalingana 
                    achievers awards. One of them got level 7 and 2 level 6s)<br>
                    o 2010 : 82%<br>
                    o 2011: 78%<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    My journey ended in 2012<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    • Unfortunately I left my learners to join Eskom on March 2012 but I cam back and do 
                    revision after marking their March exams papers.<br> 
                    • I am glad there are some learners who got scholarship at Eskom through my 
                    recommendations.<br>
                    • That why I came back in 2023 to give some learners some school shoes.<br>
                    • I am one of the actors on SABC1 number 1 series Uzalo but I know that there is 
                    another home for me Shengeza High School. ”<br>

I produced exceptional results as an Economics educator through the guidance of the former Principal Mr. Manyapye M.A, Ms. Rapagkadi S.O, Mrs. Mpanza T.P, the late Baba Mashabela, and you, Mr. Ngubane S.S, the respected current principal of the school.<br>

                    I also recall the day you fetched me at the Engen garage Mbomvu. You received me with humanity and respect. During my tenure as the SGB member, I was able to persuade the SGB to support the curriculum, extramural activities, and the refurbishment of the school sports fields.<br>

                    Words cannot express my gratitude and appreciation for your support, as you helped turn me into the leader I am today. I am immensely grateful for the valuable skills, knowledge, and growth opportunities that were presented to me during my time with the school. Thank you for the platform to learn, make mistakes, and excel in my role.<br>

                    As much as I have moved on with my journey, I remain grateful for the opportunity Shengeza has offered to me. Indeed, Shengeza is a university of leadership. Thank you. ”<br>

                    “ I, Mr. Zakwe, arrived at Shengeza High School in 2012, a novice fresh from university. When I started, Maths was my preferred subject, but as the years progressed, the management shifted me to Life Sciences, which turned out to be the best decision ever! I had an amazing experience teaching Life Science under the guidance of Mr. Zikhali, who was my Departmental Head.<br>

                    What I also liked about Shengeza High School is that it offers a variety of sporting codes, and my passion has always been soccer. So, working with a soccer team was also a great experience, and we discovered a lot of talented boys. The traveling to other schools has always been my favorite.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    The arrival of Mr. Ngubane, the current principal, was a blessing because he believes in the youth and energetic teachers, and he is a great motivator. So, working under him was the experience of a lifetime!<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br> 
                    Shengeza, my Shengeza, I will forever be grateful for the opportunity. All the things I have achieved academically and in sports are because of the skills that were harnessed at Shengeza. Rise Shengeza, Rise!!! My school, my home forever. With love from Mr. Zakwe. ”<br>
