                            The Career Exhibition Day served as a beacon of empowerment, bringing together tertiary institutions from across the region to engage with our learners.

By bringing career information directly to our learners, the district eliminated the barriers of distance and accessibility, ensuring that every student had the opportunity to explore their potential.
