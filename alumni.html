                <p class="description">
                    My name is Dr Noxolo Maria Nsele<br>
                    I was born in Manguzi, northern KwaZulu Natal where I completed my primary and secondary
                    school education.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    I am currently working at Empangeni as a paediatrician at Life Empangeni private hospital.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    Being a high school student can pose a lot of challenges, as this is a period of life that is
                    accompanied by lots of decision making and requires one to gain substantial maturity.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    My experience at Shengeza high school was filled with a lot of mixed emotions.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    The school was quite disadvantaged in a sense that we had very limited resources. We lacked a
                    library, science labs ect, and this brought some difficulties for me when I started tertiary education
                    as I was not previously exposed to those particular facilities.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    Despite all the challenges we had, many great memories were created and those will stay with me
                    for the rest of my life. The teachers were of utmost assistance and helped me transition to my
                    high school life with ease.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    Having experienced the above mentioned challenges also encouraged me to work harder in life,
                    since I had to rely on the information given to me by the teachers and limited books I had access
                    to.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    Also the school had a vibrant sport and cultural activities which I enjoyed to be part of.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    I will be forever thankful for all the assistance I received from all the teachers and staff, this has
                    helped me to be able to reach my dreams of becoming a Paediatrician<br>

                    My upbringing took place in the remote rural town of Manguzi, where I grew up and inspired by my own siblings and community.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    Attended Mnyayiza Primary school before moving on to Shengeza High for further studies. It is not only a school, but also a family and a community.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    They teach the children Christian principles and the importance of living an honorable life. I aspired to be a Medical Doctor, unsure of my chances at Shengeza High, until I saw the accomplishments of previous students, which gave me hope.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    Through my hard work, commitment, and sacrifices, I have attained everything I currently have thanks to Shengeza High. They taught me that to achieve your desires in life, you must eliminate negativity and have faith in the journey.

                    Was a learner at Shengeza between 2003-2007 in 2005 I took a decision to attend science 🧪 classes that’s includes physical science, Biology and Mathematics, the population of learners who was joining our rural school was increasing yearly because of the results of the matriculation of the previous years.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    Although the staff of Shengeza high school remain claim to achieve they Goals, the school took the place of Mnyayisa to the map of Manguzi circuit with the number of teachers achieving 100% on their subjects, allowing different teachers from different places help us to achieve our result and keep the school on the map as others.<br>

                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    I started my journey as a student at Shengeza High School from year 2004 to 2008.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    My experience at Shengeza High School has been a journey worth a climb.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    My high school is located in the deep rural areas with scarce resources despite the limitation in infrastructure and limited exposure in technology I was able to studying and get Good grades, during my years at Shengeza I got an opportunity to be Class chosen as one of the students to represent the whole school in the District for an Essay writing in 2004 and obtained position 6 from the whole district which enabled me to improve my confidence as well as self-development. I gained great experience and exposure as i was then chosen as one of the trusted students in unprepared debates in and out the school premises and where I would put my school on of the map in the debating field.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    As alluded above during my time at shengeza there was a time when i was selected as one of the students to represent the school in science expo where me and my partner designed a bridge that as of then i had developed a huge interest in Civil engineering fast forward to that I continued being a hard and dedicated leaner and end passing my matriculation in 2008 with a bachelor that gave me more chances to become or study what i had liked and loved with the bottom of my heart civil engineering.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    I have then after matriculation followed my dreams went to MUT to study Civil engineering as a deep desire and interest in the field of Construction as of today and can confidently say that I am owning and running my company called Imanathi and Seloe Trading that deals with construction of roads, houses,water infrastructure as well bridges as of today the company has employed employees from different parts of construction . Inspiration came from School and through the excellent education system and dedication of our Teachers i can attest that i am the man that i am today because of Shengeza High school as of today i still have a good relationship with my high school teachers hence they taught me manors and a way to handle myself in a way that i have one come to school and gave back to the most needy students since it is what i have learnt from them.

                    My adventure began in the crowded halls of Shengeza High School, surrounded by a cacophony of goals and aspirations. However, my route was not easy; rather, it was riddled with obstacles that challenged my commitment at every turn.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    From the start, I faced almost insurmountable challenges. Family dysfunction put a pall over my academic endeavours, threatening to ruin my dreams before they could take flight. But I refused to give into despair. With unflinching drive, I vowed to press on, knowing that hard work and dedication would lead to success.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    As the years passed, I experienced a slew of challenges that attempted to divert my attention and derail my progress. Peer pressure beckoned with its enticing charm, tempting me away from the road of diligence and discipline. Nonetheless, I stayed persistent in my dedication to academic achievement, defying the siren call of diversion with unrelenting determination.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    Amidst the bustle and clamour of high school life, one beacon of light shone brightly, illuminating my path with knowledge and direction. That beacon was none other than Mr. Mashabela, our beloved Accounting instructor, whose influence on my life extended beyond the classroom.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    Mr. Mashabela was not only a teacher; he was also a mentor, confidant, and friend. With unlimited patience and unflinching passion, he planted the seeds of knowledge in each of his students, instilling curiosity and a desire to study. His gentle counsel and wise advise acted as a compass, guiding me through the turbulent waters of puberty with grace and wisdom.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    Mr. Mashabela's influence, however, was most noticeable during my matric year. like the pressure increased and the stakes became higher, he stood by my side like a rock of strength, delivering words of encouragement and reassurance when self-doubt threatened to engulf me. His faith in my abilities ignited my desire, pulling me ahead with new vigour and zeal.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    Finally, my hard work and determination paid off, resulting in academic achievements that much above my greatest expectations. And, as I stood on the verge of a new chapter in my life, I realised that I owed everything to Mr. Mashabela's steadfast support.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    Though he is no longer with us, his legacy lives on through the many lives he touched and the hearts he inspired. And as I go on the path ahead, I carry with me the lessons he taught me and the memories we made, knowing that his spirit will always be with me, guiding me forward with love and light.<br>

                    As a alumni of Shengeza High School, I find myself reflecting on my journey through those years with gratitude. Shengeza helped me grow in many great different ways.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    It wasn't just about classes and grades but also about learning time management and facing challenges. There were both easy and challenging moments.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    These experiences taught me to be reselient, being true to my self and gave me a clear direction of who and what I wanted to be in life. Grateful for all the support I received from all the teachers, they believed in me and that motivated me to always push and aim high.<br>

                    I enrolled at Shengeza High School at the birth of the new millennium in year 2000, at the time when it was not fashionable to be a Shengeza High learner due to the then poor performance of the school. I have a very little memory of the earlier years, but I can recall that when Mr M Manyapye took over as the headmaster in 2001/2002 things started to change and discipline became the order of the day despite limited teaching resources. We did not have textbooks, libraries, computers nor laboratories.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    However, the senior educators of the school (i.e. Mr Mhlongo, S Mkhize, SS Ngubane, etc) and arrival of educators from other provinces (i.e. Ms Rapagkadi) really stabilized the school’s performance. The journey was a challenging one, but dedication, hard work, sacrifices and support from the teachers kept us going.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>  
                    I was the first matriculant to obtain 4 distinctions coming from Shengeza High School in 2004, and since then the school has been doing well as I have been following its matric performance over the years. From what I have recently observed, the school is now anchored by local educators who understand the socioeconomic dynamics of the area. This is definitely adding value in propelling the performance of the school and will go a long way in shaping the culture and identity of the school as a community institution.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>  
                    What I would like to say as an advice to current learners is that they must keep their heads up as their current situation does not define their destination. They must grab every opportunity presented and should not shy from embracing or even becoming part of changes dominated by technological advancements.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>

                    I was a student at Shengeza High School from year 2005 to 2009.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    My experience at Shengeza High School has been a journey worth a climb.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    My high school is located in the deep rural areas with scarce resources despite the limitation in infrastructure and  limited exposure in technology I was able to studying and get Good grades, during my years at Shengeza I got an opportunity to be Class Representative which enabled me to improve my personal leadership skills as well as self-debelopment. I gained great experience and exposure as a class rep, I regained my confidence.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    As alluded above during my time at shengeza there was a lot of development of infrastructure taking place and I remember one time at school there was a construction company on site that was building classes, part of the people who were on site were quantity surveyor. I remember during breaktime I went to this man who were working on site and started enquiring about their work and what they studied.<br> 
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    I developed a deep desire and interest in the field of Construction and quantity surveying today and can confidently say that I am owning and running a company called Zoko Group that deals with construction, quantity surveying and Architecture. Inspiration came from School and through the excellent education system and dedication of our Teachers I was able to strive in my Matric marks and went to University to further my studies.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    I made friend at school who later become my brother, I am a leader in different organization and the credit goes to Shengeza High School for opening an opportunity for me to Lead and also be led.

                    Being born and growing up in the rural area sometimes means a lack of  diversity and opportunities, however getting good education enabled that and Shengza High was able to do that for me,enabling a better and  succesful future for me  ,from the great and diversified teachers.

                    As a former learner at Shengeza High School, 'the school of excellence,' I started grade 8 in 2000 and completed grade 12 in 2004.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    The school shaped me into the person who I am today. I met the best teachers who taught me the true meaning of education, where I gained confidence and started working towards my goals. That was fulfilled, and I became a professional educator, starting to work at the same school, Shengeza High School, where currently I am the departmental head of communication. Skills obtained from high school as a former learner are as follows: critical thinking, communication, leadership, time management, decision making, and problem-solving skills.<br>
                    <span class="spc" style="color: #fff">Shengeza High School</span><br>
                    I'm able to work independently and cooperatively with other people, teaching learners more effectively and achieving outstanding results. I am grateful for those experiences that shaped my future.

                    Sometimes, the school was vandalized, and studying materials were stolen. Can you imagine how difficult that is? Psychologically, you are defeated. That is why I decided that I won't allow that to happen again under my watch. But with the assistance of teachers who encouraged me to keep going, I managed to conquer all.<br>
